# 🛡️ Case Study: Compliance Automation with RAG + LLMs
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline for automated compliance evaluation of regulations and organizational policies.

## 📌 Background & Problem
Organizations in regulated sectors (finance, healthcare, education, etc.) must constantly ensure that their internal policies align with external regulations.  

- Traditional compliance reviews are **manual, time-consuming, and error-prone**.  
- Policies and regulations change frequently, making static rule-based or fine-tuned ML models **costly to maintain**.  

**Business Challenge:** Automate compliance evaluation so auditors and policy teams can quickly identify gaps, reduce manual effort, and improve audit readiness.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate the process of comparing **organizational policies vs. regulations**.  
- Classify regulatory clauses as:  
        &nbsp ✅ Fully Addressed  
        ⚠️ Partially Addressed  
        ❌ Not Addressed  
- Generate **structured, interpretable reports** for compliance officers.  
- Ensure the solution is **scalable, transparent, and adaptable** across domains.

## 🏗️ Solution Approach
Designed and implemented a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** that ingests both regulations and policies, retrieves relevant matches, and applies **LLM-based classification** to assess compliance.
